# RubyChip
A Chip-8 interpreter/emulator written in Ruby

This is more of a prototype than anything else at this point, but it might be a good reference if you're looking to write your own emulator.

# Usage
<pre>bundle exec ruby main.rb PONG</pre>
Or replace PONG with any file in /programs

# Keypad
<pre>
1 | 2 | 3 | 4
Q | W | E | R
A | S | D | F
Z | X | C | V
</pre>

# Todo
- Add unit tests
- Write a better README
- Performance tuning
- Add SChip support
